= juxt.reap.interval

The basic idea is to use interval algebra to compose intervals into forms that can be used efficiently in regular expressions.

== Intervals

For example, a range from char A to char Z (inclusive) can be specified by the following vector:

[source,clojure]
----
[\A \Z]
----


== Basic interval relations

== Derived interval relations

disjoint?

separate?

encompasses?


== Splicing

== Normalization
